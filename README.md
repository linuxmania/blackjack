blackjack
=========

This is a minimal mobile web app written in javascript and capable of running on a flip phone.
The theory being that if an app runs well on a flip phone browser, then it will run well on any mobile device.
This has been tested on iPhones, Androids, other dumb smart phones, and of course flip phones.

It is configured as an eclipse javascript project, but integration with eclipse is not necessary.
The blackjack.htm file utilizes the expanded versions of the js files, while the index.htm utilizes the minimized version.
To create a minimized js file, run the make_min script.

Some noteworthy javascript functionality in this project:
  Object oriented with inheritance.
  Recursion and double recursion in the splitting of hands in player.js
